### ProgrammingPractise
## Day 1
#Today's Progress: Started practising Data Structures concepts (Arraylist)

#Thoughts: I really struggled with Arraylist,may be because of less practise but, overall, I feel very confident today about the concepts.

#Code: https://github.com/kaurgurcharan/ProgrammingPractise/blob/master/TraverseArrayList.java

## Day 2
#Today's Progress: Solved an problem to find the duplicate element from the list of elements using for loop and HashSet

#Thoughts: I always get confuse to apply the set interface operations and its implementations - HashSet, TreeSet and LisnkedListHashSet 

#Code: https://github.com/kaurgurcharan/ProgrammingPractise/blob/master/DuplicateElement.java

## Day 3
#Today's Progress: MergeSort is frequently asked interview questions

#Thoughts: It was difficult for me to solve but right logic is everything in programming. 

#Code: https://github.com/kaurgurcharan/100-days-of-code-log/blob/master/MergeSortPractise.java

## Day 4 
#Today's Progress: I learned the basics of javascript using atom text editor and made a google map that display my current location and nearby location to it.

#Thoughts: what i believe in programming is to start with the small problem and practise it, who knows what graceful application you can make through our knowledge and skills
